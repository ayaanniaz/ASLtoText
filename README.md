# ASLtoText
ASLtoText is a deep learning project that translates American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text using an LSTM-based neural network.

**Features:**

Custom ASL dataset: Collected and labeled manually for this project.

Model architecture: LSTM-based sequence model for gesture recognition.

Libraries used: TensorFlow, MediaPipe (for landmark detection), and OpenCV (for video capture and processing).

**Repository Contents:**

ASLtoText_LSTM.ipynb: Complete workflow including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

action.h5: Trained LSTM model weights.

actions.npy: List of recognized gesture labels.
